# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard
📘 Project Overview

This project is part of a Data Science course.
It focuses on collecting, cleaning, and visualizing financial data using Python.
We use Tesla and GameStop as case studies to compare their stock prices and quarterly revenues.

The final outcome is an interactive dashboard that shows how the stock price relates to company revenue over time.
